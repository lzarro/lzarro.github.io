    <h1> What is a black hole? </h1>
    <div class="mainDiv">
      <p >A black hole is one of the most intriguing and powerful phenomena in the universe. It is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles in a dramatic explosion known as a supernova. When these stars collapse under their own gravity, they create a point in space with infinite density called a singularity, surrounded by an event horizonâ€”the boundary beyond which nothing can return.</p>

      <p >Black holes are invisible to direct observation because they emit no light. However, their presence can be observed due to the effects of their intense gravitational pull on nearby stars and gas. There are several types of black holes, including stellar black holes, which are a few times the mass of our sun, and supermassive black holes, which are located at the centers of galaxies and can be billions of times more massive.</p>
      <p class="question"><i>Wait, so if they do not emit light, how do we get pictures of it?</i></p>
