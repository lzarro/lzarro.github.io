    <h1> What is a black hole? </h1>
    <div class="mainDiv">
      <p >A black hole is one of the most intriguing and powerful phenomena in the universe. It is a region in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull. Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles in a dramatic explosion known as a supernova. When these stars collapse under their own gravity, they create a point in space with infinite density called a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon—the boundary beyond which nothing can return.</p>

      </div>
      <p >Black holes are invisible to direct observation because they emit no light. However, their presence can be observed due to the effects of their intense gravitational pull on nearby stars and gas. There are several types of black holes, including stellar black holes, which are a few times the mass of our sun, and supermassive black holes, which are located at the centers of galaxies and can be billions of times more massive.</p>
      <p class="question"><i>Wait, so if they do not emit light, how do we get pictures of it?</i></p>

    <h1> Capturing the Black Hole </h1>
    <div class="mainDiv">
      <p >For a long time, black holes were just theories, known only through indirect clues and the math in Einstein's theory of relativity. They were big mysteries in space, with scientists wondering what they really looked like and how they were built. But thanks to new technology and teams of scientists from around the world, we are finally able to see and understand these massive space monsters.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: -50px;">One big breakthrough in taking pictures of black holes came with something called the <b>Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)</b>. It's like having a giant telescope as big as Earth, made by connecting lots of radio telescopes together. With this setup, scientists were able to take the first-ever picture of a black hole in April 2019. It showed the shadow of a black hole in the middle of a galaxy called M87, surrounded by a glowing ring of light made by stuff falling into the black hole.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: -50px;">Infrared photography is super important for studying black holes. It helps scientists see through space dust and capture the heat radiation coming from the hot, glowing stuff around the black hole. Using infrared, scientists can get clearer and more detailed pictures of parts of space that are normally invisible.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: -50px;">One of the people who made a huge difference in getting this amazing picture was Dr. Katie Bouman. She made a smart computer program called <b>CHIRP (Continuous High-resolution Image Reconstruction using Patch priors)</b>. This program was like a super detective, helping to put together all the data from different telescopes used in the EHT. It sorted through lots of messy data to create a clear and detailed picture of the black hole.</p>
