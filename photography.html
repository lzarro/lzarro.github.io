    <h1>Infrared Photography (IP)</h1>
    <div class="mainDiv">
      <p>Infrared photography works by capturing the heat radiation, or infrared light, emitted by objects. Here is how it works:</p>   
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="https://www.allicdata.com/upload/ueditor/image/20200619/1592533943826680.png" alt="infrared diagram" class="flex-container" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      </div>     
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrared Light:</strong> Everything emits a certain amount of infrared light, also known as heat radiation, based on its temperature. Even objects that appear dark or invisible in visible light emit infrared light.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrared Sensor:</strong> Infrared cameras use special sensors that can detect infrared light. These sensors are sensitive to a range of wavelengths beyond what the human eye can see, allowing them to capture images in the infrared spectrum.</li>
        <li><strong>Image Capture:</strong> When you take a photo with an infrared camera, the sensor records the infrared light emitted by the objects in the scene. Areas that are warmer emit more infrared light and appear brighter in the image, while cooler areas emit less and appear darker.</li>
        <li><strong>Filters:</strong> Infrared photography often uses filters to block out visible light and only allow infrared light to pass through to the sensor. This helps to enhance the contrast and clarity of the infrared image.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> After the image is captured, it may undergo some processing to adjust the colors and contrast to make the infrared features more visible and to create a final image that is easy to interpret.</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p style="margin-top: -50px;">In simpler words, infrared photography works by capturing the heat radiation emitted by objects in a scene using specialized sensors and filters, resulting in unique images that reveal details not visible to the human eye in visible light.</p>

    <h1>IP in Event Horizon Telescope</h1>
    <div class="mainDiv">
      <p>In the context of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), infrared photography plays a crucial role in observing black holes by capturing the heat radiation emitted from the hot, glowing matter surrounding them. Here is how infrared photography helps in the EHT</p>   
      <div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="https://thefederal.com/file/2021/09/eht-lead.jpg" alt="infrared diagram" class="flex-container" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
      </div>     
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Observing Through Cosmic Dust:</strong> Infrared light can penetrate cosmic dust, which often obscures the view of black holes in visible light. By using infrared photography, scientists can peer through this dust to capture images of the regions surrounding black holes.</li>
        <li><strong>Revealing Hot Matter:</strong> The intense gravity of black holes pulls surrounding matter towards them, causing it to heat up and emit infrared radiation. Infrared photography helps scientists observe this hot matter, providing valuable insights into the behavior and structure of black holes.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhancing Image Clarity:</strong> Infrared images obtained through the EHT are combined with data from other wavelengths, such as radio waves, to create a more comprehensive picture of black holes. The infrared component adds clarity and detail to these images, helping scientists better understand the properties of black holes.</li>
        <li><strong>Contributions to Image Reconstruction:</strong> Infrared data collected by the EHT, along with data from other wavelengths, are processed and analyzed using sophisticated algorithms like Katie Bouman's CHIRP. These algorithms help reconstruct high-resolution images of black holes by synthesizing data from multiple telescopes, including infrared observations.</li>
      </ul>
        
      <p style="margin-top: -50px;">Essentially, infrared photography when utilized within the framework of the EHT, provides essential information about black holes by revealing details of the surrounding hot matter. This data contributes to the overall understanding and visualization of black holes, helping scientists unravel the mysteries of these enigmatic cosmic phenomena.</p>
